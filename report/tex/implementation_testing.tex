\section{f) Implementation and testing}

\textit{There is a collection of benchmark inputs to the classical TSP on the web, see
http://www.iwr.uni-heidelberg.de/groups/comopt/software/TSPLIB95/.
These instances are stored in files following the .tsp file format, see the docu-
mentation on the homepage.
}

\textit{Implement the algorithm you developed in Part d) and run it on certain .tsp
instances, treated as inputs to the optimizing version of LazyTSP. Your software
should at least support those .tsp files where TYPE: TSP and EDGE\_WEIGHT\_TYPE:
EUC\_2D holds, see the file berlin52.tsp for an example. Solutions should be
output along with their costs according to Formula (\(\star\)). Test how the cost of the
solution varies as you increase the parameters k and m.
}

\textit{Instead of developing your software from scratch, you may build upon existing
software packages, provided all legal restrictions are obeyed.
