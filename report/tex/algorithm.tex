\section{d) Algorithm}

\textit{Find an algorithm which always gives the correct answer for an input to the
LazyTSP, i. e., which always stops and replies YES if it is given a YES-instance
and NO otherwise. The algorithm is allowed have exponential worst-case running
time but may use “smart” techniques to deal faster with some instances. In case of
a YES, your algorithm has to construct a solution \(i_1, i_2, ..., i_{n-k-m}\) in accordance
with the problem definition. Finally, extend your algorithm in order to solve the
optimizing version of the problem, i.e., it should find a solution \(i_1, i_2, ..., i_{n-k-m}\)
for which B is as small as possible.}

\textit{Describe in words how the algorithm works.}
